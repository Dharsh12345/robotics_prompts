I learned how to code and how to fix errors.

tvshow = input("What is your favorite tv show?")
if tvshow == "peppa pig":
  print("Ugh, why?")
  favecharacter = input("Who is your favorite character?")
  if favecharacter == "daddy pig":
    print("Right answer")
  else:
    print("Nah, Daddy Pig's the greatest")
elif tvshow == "paw patrol": 
  print("Aww, sad times")
else:
  print("Yeah, that's cool and allâ€¦")
  order = input("What would you like to order: pizza or hamburger? ")
  if order == "hamburger":
    print("Thank you.")
    cheese = input("Do you want cheese?")
    if cheese == "yes":
      print("You got it.")
    else: 
      print("No cheese it is.")
  elif order == "pizza":
    print("Pizza coming up.")
    toppings = input("Do you want pepperoni on that?")
    if toppings == "yes":
      print("We will add pepperoni.")
    else:
      print("Your pizza will not have pepperoni.")
