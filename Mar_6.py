I learned how to type in username and etc...
print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":
  print("welcome mark!")
else:
 print("Go away!") 
username = input("username > ")
password = input("password > ")
if username == "mark" and password == "password":
  print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne":
  print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:
  print("Go away!")
season = input("what is your favorite season?")
if season == "spring":
  print("Ah! The birds are chirping and flowers blooming.")
elif season == "summer":
   print("Catch some sun and cool off with a lemonade.")
elif season == "autumn":
  print("The leaves are changing and the air is crisp. Enjoy!")
elif season == "winter":
 print("Stay warm by the fire and watch the snow fall.")
else:
  print("I don't know that season. Please try again.")
